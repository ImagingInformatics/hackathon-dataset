Skin, Right Dorsal Forearm, Biopsy- Shave:\n    - Seborrheic keratosis and increased density of junctional melanocytes (see note).\n\nNote: Increased density of junctional melanocytes with variable atypia is\nnoted extending to tissue edges. While the findings are insufficient for the\ndiagnosis of a melanocytic neoplasm and background melanocytic hyperplasia\nis considered; clinical correlation is recommended with consideration of\nadditional sampling if there is significant residual lesion or\nrepigmentation occurs.  \n \nI ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF\nTHE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED\nTHIS REPORT.\n\nJane Doe, M.D.\n*** Report Electronically Signed Out ***"

There are several enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes including 2.7 x 2.2 cm AP window (series 3, image 22), 1.9 x 1.6 cm lower paratracheal (series 3, image 23).  There are a few small right paratracheal nodes that are not enlarged by CT size criteria.</p>\n\n<p>Evaluation of lung windows demonstrates a 4.4 x 3.4 cm left upper lobe mass with well circumscribed borders (series 3, image #12).  A smaller daughter mass measuring 1 cm is seen on (series 3, image #18).  There are no  contralateral lung nodules.  Emphysematous changes are seen greatest in the upper lobes.  No focal infiltrate or pneumothorax.  No pleural thickening or pneumothorax.</p>\n\n<p>Non-contrast evaluation of the upper abdomen is unremarkable.  The liver demonstrates homogenous attenuation.  The adrenal glands are partially imaged, but appear within normal limits.</p>\n\n<p>Evaluation of bone windows does not demonstrate suspicious lucent or sclerotic lesion.</p>\n\n<p>Impression:\n1. Left upper lobe mass, suspicious for malignancy.\n2. Mediastinal adenopathy measuring up to 2.7 cm, without contralateral lung nodules.</p></div>"

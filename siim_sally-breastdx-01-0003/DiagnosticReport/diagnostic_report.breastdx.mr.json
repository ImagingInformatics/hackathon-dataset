High-risk screening MRI exam.</p>\n\n<p>Technique: Bilateral axial imaging of the breasts was obtained including T1, STIR, T1FS, and sequential T1FS+C. Digital subtraction and dynamic contrast curve analysis was performed on a separate workstation.</p>\n\n<p>Findings:</p>\n\n<p>LEFT BREAST: There is minimal benign background enhancement. There are expected post surgical changes in the upper outer breast. Multiple signal voids represent surgical clips in place.  Skin thickening is consistent with post radiation change. There is no abnormal enhancement to indicate residual or recurrent disease.  There are no morphologically abnormal axillary lymph nodes.</p>\n\n<p>RIGHT BREAST: There is minimal benign background enhancement. There is no abnormal enhancement or lymphadenopathy.</p>\n\n<p>Impression:</p>\n\n<p>LEFT BREAST: Expected post treatment changes. Benign. BI-RADS 2. Recommend routine screening mammography in 1 year.</p>\n\n<p>RIGHT BREAST: Negative. BI-RADS 1. Recommend routine screening mammography in 1 year.</p>\n\n<p>OVERALL BI-RADS 2 (Benign)</p>\n </div>"

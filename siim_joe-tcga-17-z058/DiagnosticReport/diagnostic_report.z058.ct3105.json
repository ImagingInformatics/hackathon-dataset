There are no enlarged axillary lymph nodes. There has been interval development of an enlarged lymph node conglomerate mass within the posterior mediastinum just anterior to the descending aorta, measuring 2.8 x 4.2 cm in axial dimension <span style=\"display: inline;\" id=\"ImagingSelection/1.3.6.1.4.1.14519.5.2.1.7777.9002.988079582344471175076015633105.5.36\" class=\"reportLink\">series 5, image 36</span>. This mass anteriorly displaces and mildly narrows the left main pulmonary artery. There is no clear evidence of vascular invasion. There is stable right hilar adenopathy. A new markedly enlarged precardial lymph node is also now seen, measuring 3.3 x 1.7 cm <span style=\"display: inline;\" id=\"ImagingSelection/1.3.6.1.4.1.14519.5.2.1.7777.9002.988079582344471175076015633105.5.42\" class=\"reportLink\">series 5, image 42</span>.</p><p>There is stable severe emphysema. A 4 mm left apical nodule <span style=\"display: inline;\" id=\"ImagingSelection/1.3.6.1.4.1.14519.5.2.1.7777.9002.988079582344471175076015633105.5.6\" class=\"reportLink\">series 5, image 6</span> appears stable. Surgical changes from prior left lower lobectomy are evident with associated pleural thickening. Interval resolution of the previously noted left hydropneumothorax. A small left lateral rim enhancing pleural collection is suspicious for infection.</p><p>No suspicious osseous lesions. The visualized soft tissues are unremarkable.</p><p>Abdomen: Punctate calcifications noted in the right hepatic lobe. Liver otherwise unremarkable. Gallbladder, pancrease, speen, and adrenal glands are normal. Bilateral renal cysts are noted. The kidneys are otherwise unremarkable with normal enhancement.</p><p>An enlarged gastrosplenic node is noted, measuring 1.3 cm in short axis dimension <span style=\"display: inline;\" id=\"ImagingSelection/1.3.6.1.4.1.14519.5.2.1.7777.9002.988079582344471175076015633105.6.13\" class=\"reportLink\">series 6, image 13</span>. The visualized bowel is within normal limits.</p><p>Impression: 1. Post surgical changes from left lower lobectomy.</p><p>2. Development of posterior mediastinal and precardial lymphadenopathy concerning for disease progression. An enlarged gastrosplenic node is nonspecific and appears grossly stable compared to CT from 4/22/1986 given differences in technique.</p><p>3.

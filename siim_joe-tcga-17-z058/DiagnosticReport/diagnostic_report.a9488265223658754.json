Skin, right upper back, scapular region; shave biopsy:  \n    - Features consistent with an early evolving radial growth phase melanoma. (see Note.)\n\nNote: The lesion is small and has the silhouette of a dysplastic nevus.\nHowever, several atypical melanocytes are seen at all layers of the\nepidermis. A few similar cells are also seen in the papillary dermis. While\nwe considered a traumatized dysplastic nevus, the findings are most in\nkeeping with an early melanoma (0.25 mm thick, Clark level II,\nnon-ulcerated, with no mitosis; confined to its radial growth phase). The\ninked section margins are not involved, but the lesion extends to within < 1\nmm of a tissue edge. Levels and an immunostain for melan-A were examined.\n\nI ATTEST THAT THE ABOVE DIAGNOSIS IS BASED UPON MY PERSONAL EXAMINATION OF\nTHE SLIDES (AND/OR OTHER MATERIAL), AND THAT I HAVE REVIEWED AND APPROVED\nTHIS REPORT.\n\nJohn Doe, M.D.\n*** Report Electronically Signed Out ***"

Mild atherosclerotic changes are present in the upper abdominal aorta.</p>\n\n<p>There is a 2.2 x 1.4 cm cavitary lesion in the left upper lobe (Image 30/116). Linear bandlike areas of scarring/atelectasis are present in the right upper lobe with associated bronchiectasis. Bronchiectasis is also seen in the left upper lobe. The central airways are clear. Pleural-parenchymal scarring is present at the lung apices. There is no pleural effusion.</p>\n\n<p>There is no axillary, mediastinal, or hilar adenopathy. The thyroid gland is within normal limits.</p>\n\n<p>The visualized portions of the upper abdomen are unremarkable. No suspicious osseous lesion is seen. There is evidence of prior trauma/deformity of the right 5th rib.</p>\n\n<p>Impression:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Cavitary lesion in the left upper lobe.
